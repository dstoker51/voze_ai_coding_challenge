# AI Coding Exercise:

Below are credentials to a SQL database containing two tables Companies and Contacts. We want to devise a system that can:
- Accept an image of a business card
- Add the business on the card to the Companies table
- Add the person to the Contacts table associated with that company

The system should be able to demonstrate the following capabilities:
- If the card is for an existing contact, their information should be updated.
- If the business and contact doesn't exist in the system, add them.
- There are multiple franchises of the same business in the database. Associate new contacts with the most likely franchise.
    - The data is fictitious and ephemeral, so there is no reason the database needs to be preserved in a particular way.
